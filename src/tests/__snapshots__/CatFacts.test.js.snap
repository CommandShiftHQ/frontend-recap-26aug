      If you grow your own catnip, here's how to prepare it for kitty's enjoyment: Cut several stalks of the plant from the base. Hang them upside down in a dark and dry room for several weeks. Then cut the catnip into small pieces, rub some on your cat's favorite toys or scratching post, and let the games begin!

      The catnip plant contains an oil called hepetalactone which does for cats what marijuana does to some people. Not all cats react to it those that do appear to enter a trancelike state. A positive reaction takes the form of the cat sniffing the catnip, then licking, biting, chewing it, rub & rolling on it repeatedly, purring, meowing & even leaping in the air.
